## Introduction

The objective of this project is to produce and document a simple application using the Shiny Web Application Framework for R.

The application that was developed uses the Market Basket Analysis data set from the ElemStatLearn package.  The data set's Source is:

Impact Resources, Inc., Columbus, OH (1987). A total of N=9409 questionnaires containing 502 questions were filled out by shopping mall customers in the San Francisco Bay area.

It contains 8993 observations.  The variables that were used for this project are: Income, Sex, Edu, and Occupation.  

The application accepts the gender, education level, occupational category, and household income and compares the household income with that of observations that have matching gender, education level, and occupational category.  It presents a histogram of the relevant observations and shows how the household income specified compares
